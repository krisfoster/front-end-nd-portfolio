# Front End Web Dev Portfolio Project

This is my submission.

*IMPORTANT* In order to browse the site you will need to
install bower and use it install the deps. Instructions follow
for this.

## Installing & Setup

### Install grunt

This relies on you running OSX or linux - if you are
running Windows then you are on your own ;)

    sudo npm install -g bower
    sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
    sudo npm install grunt --save-dev
    npm install


### Building

You don't need to build as the compiled less files
are inclued in the css dir. But if you wanted to you
would proabbly do the following:

    grunt

But you definitely *DO* need to installthe deps. using
bower as the page relies on these being present.

## Images

I bought a lot of the images from Shutterstock - no stealing
here :) The rest are pubically available. Including the Bill
Murray ones which come from fillnurray.com

## Notes on Implementation

* Used less for style sheet generation as was less
verbose and allowed me to, try and, make bootstrap
a little more semantic

* I have made quite a few changes to the look and feel as
I wanted to do something a little more personal. I am not
saying that I will stay with the b-bit feel but it was functionto play with and
that is, after all, what it is all about.

** Have moved the headers over to the right - looked better IMHO

** Removed the Udacity logo. Wanted it to reflect me

* This might be a little over-engineered...
