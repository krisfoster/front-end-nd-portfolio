# Front End Web Dev Portfolio Project

## Installing & Setup

### Install grunt

This relies on you running OSX or linux - if you are
running Windows then you are on your own ;)

    sudo npm install -g bower
    sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
    sudo npm install grunt --save-dev
    npm install


### Building

You don't need to build as the compiled less files
are inclued in the css dir. But ifyou wanted to you
would proabbly do the following:

    grunt

## Images

I bought a lot of the images from Shutterstock - no stealing
here :) The rest are pubically available. Including the Bill
Murray ones which come from fillnurray.com

## Notes on Implementation

* Used less for style sheet generation as was less
verbose and allowed me to, try and, make bootstrap
a little more semantic

* This might be a little over-engineered...
